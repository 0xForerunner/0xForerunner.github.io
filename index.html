I love building things from scratch and diving into new technologies head-first. From crafting low-level systems in Rust to writing smart contracts that secure digital economies, I enjoy tackling complex problems and learning as I go.<p>In my free time, you’re more likely to find me outdoors than indoors. I live near the mountains in beautiful British Columbia, and I take full advantage of it – whether it’s snowboarding down a steep slope, kiteboarding across the Howe Sound, mountain biking on forest trails, or literally running off a cliff with a paraglider. These adrenaline-fueled hobbies help balance out the generally more relaxed life of a coder.<hr><h1 id=culture>Culture</h1><p>I believe the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to teach is by example. Over the years, I’ve gone from academia to startups to big tech, and one constant is that hands-on experience beats theory (though my inner scientist still loves a good theory). I value open communication and collaboration – whether it’s pair programming or discussing ideas on a pull request, I’m always up for knowledge sharing.<p>I’m a strong proponent of open source. Almost all the tools and frameworks I use (and build) are open source, and I love that community-driven vibe. In my view, transparency and collaboration aren’t just buzzwords; they’re how the best software gets made.<p>I also enjoy mentoring and helping new developers find their footing. Having trained newcomers in both research labs and coding teams, I’ve learned that patience, empathy, and a dash of humor go a long way in teaching.<hr><h1 id=main-areas-of-knowledge>Main areas of Knowledge</h1><ul><li><strong>Systems & Programming:</strong> I’m fluent in Rust (my go-to language these days) and comfortable with a bunch of others like C, C++, Go, and TypeScript. I love building efficient, safe systems – whether it’s a low-level, performance-critical service or just a fun CLI tool, I aim for code that’s as reliable as it is speedy.<li><strong>Blockchain & Smart Contracts:</strong> I have deep experience in blockchain development including complex work in and around the <a href=https://reth.rs/overview/ rel=noopener target=_blank>reth</a> codebase which directly underlies <a href=https://world.org/world-chain rel=noopener target=_blank>World Chain</a>. I’ve written and deployed smart contracts in both Solidity (for Ethereum and layer-2 networks like Optimism and Base) and Rust (using CosmWasm for the Cosmos ecosystem). From DeFi lending protocols to novel blockchain infrastructure, I enjoy creating the back-end logic that powers decentralized applications.<li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs:</strong> Privacy-preserving and scalable tech excites me. I’ve worked with zero-knowledge proof technologies, crafting circuits with frameworks like Noir, Gnark, Circom, and Plonky3 (to name a few). If there’s a way to use fancy math to solve a problem (and maybe confuse my coworkers with algebraic lingo), I’m there for it.<li><strong>DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS – I’ve worn the DevOps hat quite a bit. I build and deploy scalable services (often containerized and orchestrated in the cloud) to ensure that the software I write runs reliably for millions of users. I also have a strange fondness for writing CI/CD pipelines and automating everything.<li><strong>Data Analysis & Simulation:</strong> Thanks to my physics research background, I’m not afraid of big data or complex simulations. I’ve built Monte Carlo simulations (both in science and in finance contexts) and even dabbled in machine learning. Whether it’s analyzing particle collision data or blockchain transaction patterns, I enjoy digging into data to extract insights.<li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> In technology (as in science), there’s always more to learn. Over time I’ve picked up skills in everything from building bespoke electronics (soldering iron, anyone?) to designing 3D models for simulations. The list of technologies I’ve touched is long, but the key point is: I can adapt to whatever tools are needed to get the job done (and I probably already have some experience with them).</ul><hr><h1 id=my-experience>My experience</h1><h3 id=senior-rust-engineer-at-tools-for-humanity-building-the-core-of-worldcoin>Senior Rust Engineer at Tools for Humanity - <em>building the core of Worldcoin</em></h3><blockquote><p>2024 - Present</blockquote><h5 id=smart-contracts-blockchain>Smart Contracts & Blockchain</h5><ul><li><strong>Op Stack:</strong> Built and contributed to critical services and extenstions for the OP Stack, including Rollup Boost, P2P Flashblocks Propagation, and <a href=https://world.org/world-chain rel=noopener target=_blank>World Chain</a>. Many of these components involve either contributing directly to, or diving deep into the <a href=https://reth.rs/overview/ rel=noopener target=_blank>reth</a> codebase.<li><strong>Ethereum development:</strong> Built and maintained audited smart contracts in Solidity that have been deployed across Ethereum mainnet and layer-2 networks like Base and Optimism, as well as Worldcoin’s own blockchain. I’ve developed entire multi-contract protocols and the tooling to deploy and manage them seamlessly.<li><strong>Deployment tooling:</strong> Created advanced developer tools to automate contract deployment, configuration, and upgrades. (Think one-click deployment for complex protocols – because manual deploys are so 2020.)</ul><h5 id=zero-knowledge-magic>Zero-Knowledge Magic</h5><ul><li><strong>ZK circuits:</strong> Designed and implemented novel zero-knowledge proof circuits. Utilizing frameworks like Noir, Gnark, Circom, and Plonky3, I help create systems where users can prove things about their data without revealing the data itself. It’s as close to magic as coding gets, and it’s incredibly rewarding when it works.<li><strong>Privacy & scalability:</strong> Worked on integrating these ZK circuits into the Worldcoin protocol to enhance privacy and scalability. I often serve as the “bridge” between hardcore cryptography and practical product engineering – making sure all that fancy math translates into something that runs efficiently on-chain.</ul><h5 id=infrastructure-performance>Infrastructure & Performance</h5><ul><li><strong>Protocol infrastructure:</strong> Developed fundamental backend services critical to Worldcoin’s operation including a custom blockchain block builder based on Reth. In plain terms: I work on the engine that helps our blockchain run smoother and faster.<li><strong>Cloud deployment:</strong> Manage our Kubernetes clusters and cloud infrastructure on AWS, ensuring services are scalable, monitored, and resilient.</ul><h5 id=mentorship-teamwork>Mentorship & Teamwork</h5><ul><li><strong>Developer mentoring:</strong> Onboarding someone into a complex codebase (and often a new programming language) can be daunting, so I take pride in being a thorough guide. I’ve run training sessions, given countless code walkthroughs, and yes – I’m the guy who actually enjoys writing documentation for others.<li><strong>Team culture:</strong> As part of the core team, I advocate for thorough code reviews, knowledge sharing, and a blameless culture. Building cutting-edge tech is a team sport – I contribute wherever I can, whether it’s reviewing a tricky PR or brainstorming how to shave milliseconds off a cryptographic algorithm.</ul><h3 id=senior-software-engineer-at-cryptech-developments-principle-engineer-for-the-neptune-protocol>Senior Software Engineer at Cryptech Developments – <em>principle engineer for the Neptune Protocol</em></h3><blockquote><p>2021 - 2023</blockquote><h5 id=smart-contracts-defi>Smart Contracts & DeFi</h5><ul><li><strong>DeFi protocol development:</strong> Designed and implemented a complex multi-contract lending protocol called Neptune from the ground up. I wrote the smart contracts in Rust (using CosmWasm for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem) with a strong emphasis on safety, scalability, and efficiency.<li><strong>Full-stack blockchain dev:</strong> As the lead developer on Neptune, I wasn’t just writing contract code – I handled everything from core business logic to optimizing gas costs and shepherding the code through security audits. Basically, I wore all the hats at once and somehow kept my head on.</ul><h5 id=backend-automation>Backend & Automation</h5><ul><li><strong>Supporting infrastructure:</strong> Built the backend API and services to support Neptune’s front-end dApp, including a custom blockchain indexer to track protocol data in real time. If the smart contracts are the heart, this indexer was the circulatory system feeding data to the app.<li><strong>Autonomous bots:</strong> Developed an autonomous liquidation bot that continuously monitored the lending market and executed liquidations when necessary. This meant users (and my team) could sleep soundly knowing the bot would instantly handle any under-collateralized loans without human intervention or mercy. (Robots truly have no heart.)</ul><h5 id=simulation-testing>Simulation & Testing</h5><ul><li><strong>Monte Carlo simulations:</strong> Leveraged my simulation expertise to build Monte Carlo models predicting market behavior under various conditions. This helped us tune parameters (like collateralization ratios) and prepare for extreme scenarios. I basically built a mini “what-if” machine for our economy.<li><strong>Thorough testing:</strong> Implemented a comprehensive testing strategy – from unit tests to integration tests – to ensure Neptune’s smart contracts and services behaved correctly. I set up continuous integration pipelines so that every new code change was greeted with a gauntlet of tests.</ul><h3 id=academic-research-in-physics-university-of-british-columbia-university-of-alberta>Academic Research in Physics - <em>University of British Columbia & University of Alberta</em></h3><blockquote><p>2011 - 2021</blockquote><ul><li>During my time in academia (from undergrad through my Ph.D.), I worked on cutting-edge experiments in neutrino and dark matter physics. I designed and prototyped novel particle detectors (including a cryogenic liquid argon detector surrounded by silicon photomultipliers), built custom electronics for experimental setups (ever made an LED pulsing circuit with picosecond timing?), and wrote countless simulations to analyze subatomic events (GEANT4 was basically my sidekick). It was a challenging and wild journey that sharpened my problem-solving skills and taught me how to improvise with both hardware and software.<li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This research background might seem far removed from software engineering, but it gave me a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, and designing complex systems. After you’ve debugged a sensor array at -110°C in an underground lab at 3:00 am, debugging a distributed cloud service in a comfy chair doesn’t seem so intimidating!</ul><hr><h3 id=self-learner-open-source>Self Learner & Open Source</h3><p>I’ve always been a self-driven learner and an open source enthusiast. New programming language or framework? Sign me up – I’ll probably build a side project with it over a weekend. (That’s how I fell in love with Rust, by the way.) I enjoy contributing to open source projects and have even published a few Rust libraries of my own. The open source community has taught me so much, and I love giving back to it whenever I can.<p>I’m also the kind of person who will take on random tech challenges for fun, whether it’s fiddling with a new machine learning model, trying to throw together a game in a new engine, or automating some odd home project with a Raspberry Pi. Programming started as a hobby long before it became my career, and that curiosity still drives me.<p>If you’re curious about what I’m currently hacking on, feel free to check out my GitHub. You might find some experimental projects, contributions to blockchain infrastructure, or other curiosities. Don’t be a stranger – I’m always happy to connect with fellow developers and open source aficionados.<hr><h3 id=formal-education>Formal education</h3><p><strong>Ph.D. in Physics</strong> – University
